# Welcome to Mad Libs
Mad libs are a type of word game that involves a short story or paragraph with blank spaces for different types of words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

## How to play
A player is asked to fill in these blanks with their own words without knowing the context of the story. When these blanks have been filled, the story is read, often resulting in humorous or silly outcomes due to unexpected combinations of words. Mad libs are often used as a fun activity for groups of people or as a way to teach language arts concepts such as parts of speech.
